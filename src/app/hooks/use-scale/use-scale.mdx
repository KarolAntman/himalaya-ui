# useScale

Remember the elastic scaling feature mentioned in the [scale](/guide/scale 'Scale') subsection,
which gave the Himalya components amazing imagination and extensibility,
and now you can add elastic scaling features to your own components with the help of the `useScale` hooks.

## Scale the width

As a first example, let's prepare a simple component with a fixed width:

```tsx
const MyComponent = ({ width: string = '20px' }) => {
  return <div style={{ width }}>Scale Component</div>
}
```

Although the component accepts a `string` parameter to define the `width`, we can't control the multiplier of the width,
say `1.35` times the width, unless it's manually calculated and then filled in, which seems fine,
but when our component can set more than 10 styles, the calculation of these values is very tedious.

Now we try to bind the component to the scale of Himalya:

```tsx
import { withScale, useScale } from '@himalaya-ui/core'

const MyComponent = () => {
  const { RESPONSIVE, SCALER } = useScale()
  return (<div className={'component'}>
    <span>Scale Component</span>
      <style jsx>{`
      ${RESPONSIVE.w(1.25, value => `width: ${value};`, undefined, 'component')}
      ${SCALER('component')}
    `}</style>
    </div>
    );
}

export default withScale(MyComponent)
```

`withScale` can transform any component into a dynamically scaled component and automatically **add props and types** to the component.
You just need to set `useScale` within the component to get the `SCALES`, and then add the bindings for the `SCALES` for each style.

The default unit of Scale is `16px`, when we need to set the default width to `20px`, Obviously `20px` is 1.25 times more than `16px`,
so we get `SCALES.w(1.25)`.

The components of the above example should be used as follows:

```tsx
<MyComponent w={0.5} />
<MyComponent w="10px" />
<MyComponent w="auto" />
<MyComponent unit="10rem" />
```

## Unconventional defaults

In a few components where we want the default width to be `auto` (or others), and allow user-defined `width` to override this value,
then within the Scale component we want to follow the following rules:

- When the initial value is a special character (`initial` etc.), the component cannot be scaled by a factor of.
- The user can still override the initial value with the specified value.

For a simple component, the following example can be used to illustrate:

```tsx
const MyComponent = () => {
  const { SCALES } = useScale()
  return <div style={{ width: SCALES.w(1, 'auto') }}>Fixed Component</div>
}

export default withScale(MyComponent)
```

When we use this component, the width cannot be scaled by a multiple anymore:

```tsx
<MyComponent w={0.1} />

// -> The width is still "auto"
// -> "auto" cannot be calculated mathematically
```

When we enter specific values to override, it still works well:

```tsx
<MyComponent w="100px" />

// -> The width is "100px"
```

## Get native props

When a component is combined with `withScale`, multiple props and corresponding types are automatically added,
we can use the `useScale` function to get the corresponding value.
Note, however, that the value obtained from the `useScale` function is computed, not the native value.

```tsx
const MyComponent = () => {
  const { SCALES } = useScale()

  console.log(SCALES.w(1))

  return null
}

<MyComponent w={2} />  // output -> 'calc(2 * 16px)'
<MyComponent />            // output -> '16px'
```

The value obtained from `SCALES.w` is not exactly equal to the user input (`w=`),
because we want to make sure that the component works even if the user does nothing.
So, if you need to get the **native value** of the user input, use a separate function to get:

```ts
const MyComponent = () => {
  const { getScaleProps } = useScale()
  console.log(getScaleProps('w'))
  return null
}

<MyComponent w={2} />     // output -> 2
<MyComponent w="20px" />  // output -> '20px'
<MyComponent />               // output -> undefined
```
