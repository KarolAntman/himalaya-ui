# useConfig

This hooks can get the theme states of Himalya within any component, and can track changes in states.
In the default scenario (you haven't changed the `themeType`), hooks gets the same value as `Themes.getPresets`.

Usually the components from Himalya are already added with theme states, you don't need to change it,
this hooks just helps you to build your own components using Himalya's themes.

Notice in the example below that after we define the component using Theme,
the properties of the custom component will change according to the current Himalya's theme,
switching themes in the upper right corner of the website, the color of the components we create will also change with the theme.

<Playground
  scope={{ useConfig, Button }}
  desc=""
  code={`
() => {
  const {theme, layout} = useConfig()
  return (
    <div style={{
        width: '200px',
        height: '50px',
        borderRadius: 'var(--layout-radius),
        background: theme.palette.background.hex_700
      }}
    >
      <span style={{
          color: theme.palette.background.hex_200,
          pl: layout.gapQuarter
        }}
      >My first component.</span>
    </div>
  )
}
`}
/>
