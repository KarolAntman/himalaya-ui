## Introduction

### About

**Himalaya** is an elegant and beautiful React component library with Geek style,
originating from [Vercel](https://vercel.com?utm_source=geist-ui&utm_campaign=oss) design system and the [Geist UI](https://geist-ui.dev/).

With Himalaya's unique advantages in text layout, optimization of light and dark lines, and scale components,
you can easily create clean and powerful personal sites, or quickly build modern web applications based on highly customizable design system.
