# Server Render

**All Components of Himalaya** are compatible with Server Render. In fact, the document you see now is rendered by the server.

A common React component rendered as an HTML string on the server side usually has two parts: HTML skeleton and styles,
together, they form the first string returned to the request,
which effectively ensures that the user reads the page content as early as possible.
(without having to wait for additional JavaScript resources to be loaded and parsed)

In Himalya, all you have to do is add the style string generated by Himalya to the server-side rendering tool, whether it's Next.js or a self-built HTTP server.

## Next.js

In `next.js` framework, you need customization a client component file such as `app/page.tsx`,

Then we add the following code to the file:

```js
// NAME:app/page.tsx
import { ConfigProvider } from '@himalaya-ui/core/use-context';
import NextStyleRegistry from '@himalaya-ui/core/next/registry';
export default function Page({
  children,
}: {
  children: React.ReactNode
}) {
  return (
    <html>
      <body>
        <NextStyleRegistry>
          <ConfigProvider>
            {children}
          </ConfigProvider>
        </NextStyleRegistry>
      </body>
    </html>
  )
}
```
