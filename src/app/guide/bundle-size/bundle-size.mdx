# Bundle Size

The size of Himalya UI at the completion of full packing is about [111kb](https://bundle.js.org/?q=@himalaya-ui/core) (Gzipped),
This is a good score when comparing the size of modern client applications and will not impact the performance of your application.
As a matter of engineering practice, it is recommended that you always split Himalya as a separate chunk within your application to get fixed caching.

For higher first screen load speed, try using [Server Side Rendering](/guide/server-render) or perform volume optimization as described below.

## Auto Tree-shaking

For projects using `webpack 5.0` or higher, there is no need to add any configuration to get full tree-shaking.
As long as you use the ES module to import Himalya UI, you can automatically remove unnecessary components during bundle.

Generally this means that the scaffolding you are using needs to be larger than the following versions

- Next.js: `>= 13.0`

## Import single component manually

For projects with package size requirements, you can choose to import single component manually.

Manually import single components does not guarantee 100% that only a single component will be packaged,
as some components will depend on each other, for example, if only a single `Snippet` component is used in a project, the bundle package
will also contain the `Toast` component. However, this type of optimization can still reduce the size of your application significantly,
provided you only use a small amount components.

```jsx
import Button from '@himalaya-ui/core/button'

const MyComponent = () => <Button>Submit</Button>
```

## With Babel

If your project does not support ES Module at the moment, you can use the Babel plugin to reduce the build size.

Himalya follows the Tree Shaking naming scheme (from community convention), this will be helpful for some legacy projects.
This allows you to import in the full amount of components, but automatically exclude the parts that are not really used when packaging.
This feature is usually used in conjunction with the [babel-plugin-import](https://www.npmjs.com/package/babel-plugin-import) tool.

A classic use case is to add the following config to the `.babelrc`:

```json
// NAME:.babelrc
{
  "plugins": [
    [
      "import",
      {
        "libraryName": "himalaya",
        "libraryDirectory": "esm"
      }
    ]
  ]
}
```
